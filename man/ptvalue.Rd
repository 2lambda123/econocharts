\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric. Vector of gain / loss values for x.}

\item{sigma}{Number. Exponent of functions, should be less than 1 to make an
'S' shaped curve.}

\item{lambda}{Number. Extent of asymmetry between losses and gains. Should be
less than -1 for losses to be more 'intense' than gains (as suggested by
Prospect Theory). Between -1 and 0 for gains to be more intense than
losses. Greater than 0 for losses to have positive value.}

\item{xint}{Numeric. Symmetric intersections. X-intercept values where to
highlight points -- will be placed at both \code{xint} and \code{abs(xint)} to
demonstrate asymmetry in \code{value}.}

\item{xintcol}{Color of dashed lines calling-out \code{xint}.}

\item{main}{Main title of the plot.}

\item{sub}{Subtitle of the plot.}

\item{xlab}{Name of the X-axis.}

\item{ylab}{Name of the Y-axis.}

\item{col}{Color of function segment.}

\item{bg.col}{Background color.}

\item{ticks}{TOOD}

\item{xlabels}{TRUE / FALSE :  whether x labels are included.}

\item{ylabels}{TRUE / FALSE :  whether y labels are included.}

\item{by_x}{Number. Increment of the x-axis labels.}

\item{by_y}{Number. Increment of the x-axis labels.}
